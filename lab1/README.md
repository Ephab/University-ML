# Lab 1

## Tasks done:
- ### Read the student's guidelines & other provided files

---

- ### I already use Git so I didn't set that up again, and I will continue using my existing installation instead. I also read through the `Getting Started with Git and GitHub - Manual.pdf` file to refresh my memory on anything that I forgot.

---

- ### For GitHub im using my existing account and I created a seperate repository for the Machine Learning labs.
